<!--Put your questions into your HTML

Now let's restructure your HTML so that it has a heading, a brief descriptive paragraph, and then has the questions themselves displayed on the page inside of some kind of small heading tags, like <h3> or <h4>. You no longer need the earlier HTML that had all of the descriptive stuff about the JS logic and process, so just delete it. Once your HTML looks good, do an add-commit-push cycle.

Your TAs need a laugh. Add a joke to your README file.

Let's lighten the mood: tell us a joke. You only need to keep it moderately clean! Once it is in place, do an add-commit-push cycle. -->
